Several bug fixes, an update to the Materialize framework, and upload anywhere + new lightbox.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed "Important Notes" getting stuck when you enter only spaces
- Fixed drag and drop so it doesn't trigger the upload popup

## New Features

- Both V1 and V2 profiles use the new uploader for images
- The new uploader is available anywhere, just drag and drop!
- New lightbox for all image views, including timeline
- Back/forward navigation in the lightbox

## Minor Things

- Added more translations throughout the app
- Images now crop to the top, not the center, by default

## Framework

- Added Prettier to clean up Javascript and maintain a standard style
- Updated Materialize to 1.0.0 (which might break old V1 code)
- Tighter integration with the Apollo / GraphQL cache for more dynamic page updates
- Added React component `compose()` helper to encourage state / HOC bindings
