        %p We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.

        %p Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.

      .col.m4
        .tl-dr We're not doing anything illegal, we're telling you WHY we're collecting your information (generally), and we'll try to use it for that reason.

        %p Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

          We're only going to collect what we need, for as long as we need, to function. I don't need to know what color shirt you're wearing. We'll also try and secure this information, and we're happy to tell you all about it! (if you ask)

    .row
      .col.m8
        %p We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained. Refsheet.net may change this privacy policy from time to time at Refsheet.net's sole discretion.
