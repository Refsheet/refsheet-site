Help us help you! Please choose one:

- [ ] My app crashes with `react-rails`, so I've included the stack trace and the exact steps which make it crash.
- [ ] My app doesn't crash, but I'm getting unexpected behavior. So, I've described the unexpected behavior and suggested a new behavior.
- [ ] I'm trying to use `react-rails` with another library, but I'm having trouble. I've described my JavaScript management setup (eg, Sprockets, Webpack...), how I'm trying to use this other library, and why it's not working.
- [ ] I have another issue to discuss.
